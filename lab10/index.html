<h1>Gillian Hahn's Biography</h1>
    
    <p>Hello, my name is Gillian Hahn and I am a current sophomore in the <strong>School of Information Studies (iSchool)</strong> at Syracuse University. Right now, I am pursuing a major in Information Management Technology, and I am planning on a concentration in either web design or digital retail management.</p>    
    <p>I also am pursuing a minor in Newhouse in public communications. With  this combination of major and minor, I hope to get a job one day that connects the two.</p>

 <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>Outside of school, my favorite thing to do is ski. However, I also love to hike, camp, play sports, and hang out with my dog, my family and friends. I am currently watching 30 Rock on Netflix and Game of Thrones for the second time. My number one goal everyday is to spend as much time outside as possible.</p>

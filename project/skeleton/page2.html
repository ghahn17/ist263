<h1>Skiing takes many different forms. Here are the basic 3:</h1>  
    </header>
<article>
<h2>Freeskiing:</h2>
<p>Freeskiing is exactly what it sounds like. There are no real rules to freeskiing, except that you must be actually doing the act of skiing, i.e having skis on your feet. Typically, freeskiing implies someone skiing at a resort or mountain with leisure. However, skiing can be done anywhere with snow. They have no goals, no times to beat, and no limits. A freeskier can simply ski anywhere on snow, as fast or slow as they want. This can include double black diamonds, tree trails, the terrain park, or the bunny hill. Freeskiers can be any ability level, which therefore means that every skier, at one point or another, was probably freeskiing. This makes freeskiing the most popular and widespread type of skiing because it can be done by virtually anyone.</p>
<h3>Freeskiing Equipment:</h3>
<p>•	Boots
    •	Skis
    •	poles
    •	Bindings 
    •	Helmet
    •	Goggles
    •	Jacket 
    •	Pants 
    •	Gloves/mittens
    </p>

<h2>Backcountry Skiing:</h2>
<p>Backcountry skiing requires double the equipment of freeskiing, and often double the ability. Essentially, backcountry skiing is done without the help of a chairlift. Which means the only way up is to climb or hike. This type of skiing is typically done in remote areas of the mountains where there are no resorts, or at resorts before or after the chairlifts start running. To climb up said mountains, backcountry skiers use different bindings than freeskiers or racers, ones where the heel can release, which allows the user to hike uphill easier. Along with these bindings, skiers attach “skins” to the bottom of skis, which provides a non-slide surface, so one can hike without sliding on snow. Not only are backcountry skiers advanced level, but they are also in great shape. Hiking with a heavy pair of skis on your back as well as other gear in cold temperatures and at high elevations requires a certain level of athleticism. When it’s not winter, you will find backcountry skiers trail running, hiking, or mountain biking to keep their bodies in pristine shape for ski season. Finally, backcountry skiing requires sheer knowledge of the mountains and snow. Courses are offered on avalanches, snow depth, and more to prepare skiers for what conditions they may encounter.</p>

<h2>Racing</h2>
<p>Ski racing, again, is exactly what it sounds like. In ski racing, the main goal is to ski as fast as you can around a set of gates. Time is the main component in racing, which makes this the most quantitatively competitive type of skiing. There are two main types of racing, Slalom and Giant Slalom. Slalom (SL for short) involves shorter, quicker turns on a tighter course where the gates are closer together. Giant Slalom (GS for short) involves longer, more precise turns where the gates are further apart. These two types require slightly different muscles and gear, as with GS you want longer skis for more grip on the snow, whereas with SL you want shorter skis to make quick turns. Racing also requires significant athletic ability and control. Workouts have been designed to target leg strength and balance specifically for racers, as sometimes they travel close to 100 mph. Ski racing has become a popularized Olympic sport and is now a D1 sport at many colleges across the country.</p>

    •	Slalom skis 
    •	GS Poles
    •	SL poles
    •	High stiffness boots 
    •	Pole guards
    •	Hard-ear helmet
    •	Shatter resistant goggles

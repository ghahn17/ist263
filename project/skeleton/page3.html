<h1>Gillian Hahn’s Top Places to Ski Around the World:</h1> 
<h4>There are hundreds of thousands of ski mountains around the world. I've only been to maybe 65. Here is my list of favorite places to ski, and where I think every skier should ski before they die.</h4>

<p>Beaver Creek is the best scaled-back Colorado skiing. It offers decent amounts of snow, varying terrain, all with less crowds than many of the other large Colorado resorts, like Vail, Breckenridge, and Telluride. Beaver creek is also home to backcountry skiing with runs that last for miles. It is also a very hot destination for US Alpine Ski Racing, where they hold yearly races and competition to see some of the best racers in the world compete. As for Apres ski (meaning after ski activities), Beaver Creek has a nice downtown area built into the base of their mountain, which makes it fun for anyone. </p>

<h2>4. Steamboat Resort – Steamboat Springs, Colorado, USA </h2>

<p>Similar to Beaver Creek, Steamboat boasts insane skiing with less crowds than other resorts. However, Steamboat differs from BC in that they have far more skiable terrain. Steamboat offers an entire backside section where the snow is natural and untouched, which allows massive amounts of snow to pile up. Steamboat Springs, where the resort is located, is the quintessential mountain with fun restaurants and things to do when not skiing. Also, the hot chocolate is amazing. </p>

<p>Skiing anywhere in Switzerland is epic, but GW is special. The resort is set in the foothills between two massive peaks, which makes for a unique ski experience. On one side, there is the town of Wengen, and on the other – the town of Grendelwald. Both are like what is seen in the movies; snow covered swiss chalets with delicious chocolate and Christmas like vibes. When skiing at the mountain, you can ski down to either village at any time. Nestled in the swiss alps, GW has some of the best views and has long fun trails for skiing. </p>

<h2>2. Big Sky Resort – Big Sky, Montana, USA</h2>
<img src="../images/mountain.jpg" alt="Big Sky Mountain Resort">
<p>The name tells it all. It truly is the biggest skiing in America. With dozens of peaks and nearly 20 chairlifts, this resort is huge. However, Big Sky is a hidden gem of American skiing. Even with it being the only major resort in Montana, Big Sky is not famous for long lift lines. Big Sky also has Lone Peak Tram, which is a small gondola that travels from the base of a bowl to the top of Lone Peak, the tallest peak on the resort. From there, you need an avalanche beacon and a safety protocol to check in with ski patrol, because the skiing is so advanced and the snow is so deep. Needless to say, Big Sky speaks for itself. </p>

<h2>1. Sunday River Resort – Bethel, Maine, USA</h2>

<p>Yes. The best ski resort is in Maine. Sunday River is truly the perfect place. With 8 peaks, Sunday River is the biggest resort in Maine but not anywhere near the size of the resorts out west. However, Sunday River holds that special New England ski town charm. The trails are steep, the trees are tight, and the snow is plentiful. Bethel, the mountain town SR is located in, has bars and restaurants that have been open for hundreds of years. Sunday River is number one simply because it consistently delivers with great conditions and good times, and it’s never let me down. </p>

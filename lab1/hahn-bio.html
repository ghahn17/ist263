    Hello, my name is Gillian Hahn and I am a current sophomore in the School of Information Studies (iSchool) at Syracuse University. Right now, I am pursuing a major in Information Management Technology, and I am planning on a concentration in either web design or digital retail management. I also am pursuing a minor in Newhouse in public communications. With this combination of major and minor, I hope to get a job one day that connects the two. Outside of school, my favorite thing to do is ski. However, I also love to hike, camp, play sports, and hang out with my dog and family/friends. I am currently watching 30 Rock on Netflix and Game of Thrones for the second time.
